<p>
  
Last Updated: March 511, 2018
Welcome, and thank you for your interest in IiPoetTree, Inc., a 501(c)(3) organization (“IiPoetTree” or “We” or “Us”), which operates the web site located at http://iPoetTree.org and related application programming interfaces (API’s), mobile applications and online services (the “Website”). The following Terms of Service are a legal contract between you (“You”) and IiPoetTree regarding your use of the Website. Visitors and users of the Website are referred to individually as “User” and collectively as “Users”.
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY. BY REGISTERING FOR, ACCESSING, BROWSING, OR USING THE WEBSITE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE IPOETTREE PRIVACY NOTICE AND ANY ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES (AS DEFINED BELOW) (COLLECTIVELY, THE “TERMS”). 
IF YOU ARE A PARENT OR GUARDIAN AND YOU PROVIDE CONSENT FOR YOUR CHILD TO REGISTER WITH THE WEBSITE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF SERVICE IN RESPECT OF SUCH CHILD’S USE OF THE WEBSITE.
1. Eligibility; Accounts. THE WEBSITE IS NOT AVAILABLE TO (A) ANY USERS PREVIOUSLY SUSPENDED OR REMOVED FROM THE WEBSITE BY IPOETTREE OR (B) ANY PERSONS UNDER THE AGE OF 13 WHOSE REGISTRATION HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED BY A LEGAL PARENT OR GUARDIAN. By clicking the “I Agree” button or by otherwise using or registering an account for the Website, You represent (a) that You have not been previously suspended or removed from the Website by IiPoetTree; (b) that You are either (i) at least 13 years of age or (ii) Your parent and/or guardian has consented to Your use of the Website; and (c) that your registration and your use of the Website is in compliance with any and all applicable laws and regulations. 
1.1 Account. In order to use certain features of the Website, you must register for an account. You may be asked to provide a password in connection with your account. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, and You agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. You agree that the information You provide to IiPoetTree, whether at registration or at any other time, will be true, accurate, current, and complete. You also agree that You will ensure that this information is kept accurate and up-to-date at all times. If You have reason to believe that your account is no longer secure (e.g., in the event of a loss, theft or unauthorized disclosure or use of your account ID or password), then You agree to immediately notify IiPoetTree at information.iPoetTree@gmail.com. You may be liable for the losses incurred by IiPoetTree or others due to any unauthorized use of your Website account.
1.2 Integrated Service. IiPoetTree may permit You to register for the Website through, or otherwise associate your IiPoetTree account with, certain third party social networking or integrated services, such as Facebook Connect and Google (“Integrated Service”). By registering for the Website using (or otherwise granting access to) an Integrated Service, you agree that IiPoetTree may access your Integrated Service’s account information, and you agree to any and all terms and conditions of the Integrated Service regarding your use of the Website via the Integrated Service. You agree that any Integrated Service is a Reference Site (as defined below) and you are solely responsible for your interactions with the Integrated Service as a result of accessing the Website through the Integrated Service. IiPoetTree does not control the practices of Integrated Services, and you are advised to read the Privacy Policy and terms and conditions of any Integrated Service that you use to understand their practices.
1.3 Child User. If You are a User of the Website and are under the age of 13 (“Child User”), You may not register an account for the Website without consent and approval from your legal parent or guardian. A Child User that begins the registration process for himself or herself without a Parent User may have the registration process restricted until a Parent User approves or assumes responsibility for the Child User account. Additionally, a Child User may use the Website if registered through certain educational organizations or, in certain cases (as defined below), by Coaches that have entered into a relationship directly with IiPoetTree and through which education organization or Coach the legal parent and/or guardian of such Child User has consented to use of the Website. Further, in certain instances, a Child User may use our Website via one of the third party applications that integrate into or with the Website. A Child User that has registered through such external educational organizations, third party applications, or Coaches will only be permitted to use the Website for so long as IiPoetTree reasonably believes that such access has been consented to by the Child User’s parent or guardian. 
1.4 Parent User. If You are at least 18 years of age and you are the legal parent or guardian of a child that seeks to register as a Child User of the Website, You may register a parent account on the Website (“Parent User”). As a Parent User, you may create, register, manage and approve Child User accounts only for your own child(ren) or child(ren) for whom you are a legal guardian. IF YOU REGISTER, APPROVE THE REGISTRATION OF, OR OTHERWISE ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY CHILD USER, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE SUCH CHILD USER’S LEGAL PARENT OR GUARDIAN AND YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS ON BEHALF OF SUCH CHILD USER, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION BEING LIABLE FOR ALL USE OF THE WEBSITE BY THE CHILD USER. You acknowledge that IiPoetTree may choose, but is not obligated, to make any inquiries, either directly or through third parties, that IiPoetTree deems necessary to validate Your registration information, including without limitation engaging third parties to provide verification services. IiPoetTree reserves all rights to take legal actions against anyone who misrepresents personal information or is otherwise untruthful about their identity. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IPOETTREE CANNOT GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY OF ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY ANY USER AND IPOETTREE IS NOT OBLIGATED TO VERIFY THE IDENTITY OF ANY USER, INCLUDING ANY USER’S CLAIM TO BE A PARENT USER, OR TO VERIFY THAT A PARENT IDENTIFIED BY A CHILD USER OR A COACH DURING REGISTRATION IS SUCH CHILD USER’S ACTUAL PARENT OR GUARDIAN. A Parent User account, along with all associated Child User accounts, may be terminated by IiPoetTree at any time and without warning for any failure to abide by these Terms. 
1.5 Coach. IiPoetTree may make available certain features and tools that permit certain Users (such as, for example, representatives of school districts, schools, teachers, and other educators) to work with students and other Users through the Website in order to provide such students and other Users with tutorial, educational and other education-related services, and to review and evaluate educational achievement and progress of such students and other Users (each a “Coach”). If you are a Coach, you must use IiPoetTree’s Coach registration process when registering accounts on the Website for one or more of your students. IF YOU ARE A COACH AND YOU REGISTER AN ACCOUNT FOR A CHILD USER, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE RECEIVED EXPRESS CONSENT FROM SUCH CHILD USER’S PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN FOR YOU TO REGISTER THE CHILD USER FOR THE WEBSITE AND FOR YOU TO PROVIDE TO IPOETTREE THE INFORMATION YOU DISCLOSE IN CONNECTION WITH THE REGISTRATION OF SUCH CHILD USER. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, YOU FURTHER AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF SUCH CHILD USER, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION BEING LIABLE FOR ALL USE OF THE WEBSITE BY THE CHILD USER, FOR SO LONG AS THE CHILD USER IS NOT OTHERWISE ASSOCIATED WITH OR ASSUMED BY A VALID PARENT USER ACCOUNT. You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless IiPoetTree against any and all claims, losses, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to (a) your violation of any provision, representation or warranty this Section 1.5; (b) the use of the Website by the Child User; (c) your failure to obtain sufficient parental or legal guardian consent; (d) your registration of the Child User, or (e) any other action related to the Child User. 
2. Privacy Notice. Your privacy is important to IiPoetTree. Please read the IpiPoetTree Privacy Notice., hereby incorporated into the Terms, carefully for information relating to IiPoetTree’s collection, use, and disclosure of Your personal information.

4. Modification of the Terms. IiPoetTree reserves the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of the Terms at any time. Please check the Terms and any Guidelines periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Website after the posting of changes constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes. For any material changes to the Terms, IiPoetTree will make reasonable effort to provide notice to you of such amended Terms, such as by an email notification to the address associated with your account or by posting a notice on the Website, and such amended terms will be effective against You on the earlier of (i) your actual notice of such changes and (ii) thirty days after IiPoetTree makes reasonable attempt to provide you such notice. Disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved in accordance with the version of the Terms in place at the time the dispute arose. 
5. User Content License Grant; Representations and Warranties. 
5.1 User Content. IiPoetTree may permit (a) the posting and/or publishing by You and other Users of poems and other literary works, notes, questions, comments, ratings, reviews, images, videos and other audio-visual materials and communications (collectively, “User Postings”) and (b) the posting, creation, or modification by You and other users of computer code (including source code and object code) (“User Code”) (User Postings and User Code, collectively, “User Content”). You understand that whether or not such User Content is published, IiPoetTree does not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any submissions. 
5.2 License Grant to IiPoetTree. By posting, submitting or distributing User Content on or through the Website, You hereby grant to IiPoetTree a worldwide, non-exclusive, transferable, assignable, fully paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable right and license to host, transfer, display, perform, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, use, make, have made, sell, offer for sale, import, and otherwise exploit your User Content, in whole or in part, in any media formats and through any media channels (now known or hereafter developed).

5.4 User Content Representations and Warranties. You are solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting, creating, or publishing them. You represent and warrant that: (1) You are the creator and owner of or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to use and to authorize IiPoetTree and IiPoetTree’s Users to use and distribute your User Content as necessary to exercise the licenses granted by You in these Terms and in the manner contemplated by IiPoetTree and these Terms; (2) your User Content does not and will not: (a) infringe, violate, or misappropriate any third-party right, including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right or (b) slander, defame, libel, or invade the right of privacy, publicity or other property rights of any other person; and (3) your User Content does not contain any viruses, adware, spyware, worms, or other malicious code. 
5.5 Access to Your User Content. IiPoetTree may permit Users to share their User Content with a select group of other Users, or make their User Content public for all (even non-Website users) to view. You acknowledge and agree that, although IiPoetTree may provide certain features intended to allow you to restrict some User Content you create from others, IiPoetTree does not guarantee that such User Content will never be accessible by others.

IPOETTREE HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO ANY RESTRICTED USER CONTENT.

7. Proprietary Materials; Licenses 
7.1 Proprietary Materials. The Website is owned and operated by IiPoetTree. The visual interfaces, graphics, design, compilation, information, computer code (including source code or object code), software, services, content, educational videos and exercises, and all other elements of the Website (the “Website Materials”) are protected by United States and international copyright, patent, and trademark laws, international conventions, and other applicable laws governing intellectual property and proprietary rights. Except for any User Content provided and owned by Users and except as otherwise set forth in this Section 7, all Website Materials, and all trademarks, service marks, and trade names, contained on or available through the Website are owned by or licensed to IiPoetTree, and IiPoetTree reserves all rights therein and thereto not expressly granted by these Terms. 
7.2 Licensed Educational Content. IiPoetTree may make available on the Website certain educational videos, exercises, and related supplementary materials that are owned by IiPoetTree or its third-party licensors (the “Licensed Educational Content”). IiPoetTree grants to yYou a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access and use the Licensed Educational Content as made available on the Website by IiPoetTree solely for your personal, non-commercial purposes. Unless expressly indicated on the Website that a particular item of Licensed Educational Content is made available to Users under alternate license terms, you may not download, distribute, sell, lease, modify, or otherwise provide access to the Licensed Educational Content to any third party. 
(a) Alternate Licenses. In certain cases, IPoetTree or its licensors may make available Licensed Educational Content under alternate license terms, such as a variant of the Creative Commons License (as defined below) (each, an “Alternate License”). Where expressly indicated as such on the Website, and subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms, the applicable Licensed Educational Content is licensed to You under the terms of the Alternate License. By using, downloading, or otherwise accessing such Licensed Educational Content, You agree to comply fully with all the terms and conditions of such Alternate License. 
(b) Creative Commons License. Unless expressly otherwise identified on the Website with respect to a particular item of Licensed Educational Content, any reference to the “Creative Commons”, “CC” or similarly-phrased license shall be deemed to be a reference to the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 United States License (available at http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/) (the “Creative Commons License”). 
7.3 Licensed Educational Code. IPoetTree may make available, or allow Users to create and make available, on or through the Website certain educational, user-readable source code in connection with the “Computer Science” modules or exercises available on the Website (the “Licensed Educational Code”). Unless otherwise indicated, all Licensed Educational Code is the property of IPoetTree or third-party licensors and, subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms, is licensed to You under the terms of the MIT License. By downloading or otherwise accessing such Licensed Educational Code, You agree to comply with all the terms of the MIT License. 
7.34 Non-Commercial Use. The Licensed Educational Content and Licensed Educational Code areis intended for personal, non-commercial use only. Without limiting the foregoing, and notwithstanding the terms of any Alternate License for such Licensed Educational Content, the Licensed Educational Content may not be used, distributed or otherwise exploited for any commercial purpose, commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, unless otherwise previously agreed in writing by IiPoetTree. 
(a) Impermissible Uses. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following are types of uses that IiPoetTree expressly defines as falling outside of “non-commercial” use: 
i. the sale or rental of (1) any part of the Licensed Educational Content, (2) any derivative works based at least in part on the Licensed Educational Content, or (3) any collective work that includes any part of the Licensed Educational Content; 
ii. providing training, support, or editorial services that use or reference the Licensed Educational Content in exchange for a fee; and 
iii. the sale of advertisements, sponsorships, or promotions placed on the Licensed Educational Content, or any part thereof, or the sale of advertisements, sponsorships, or promotions on any website or blog containing any part of the Licensed Educational Material, including without limitation any “pop-up advertisements”. 
(b) Use Characterization. Whether a particular use of the Licensed Educational Content is “non-commercial” depends on the use, not the user. Thus, a use of the Licensed Educational Content that does not require that users pay fees and that does not provide an entity with a commercial advantage is “non-commercial,” even if this use is by a commercial entity. Conversely, any use that involves charging users in connection with their access to the Licensed Educational Content is not “non-commercial,” even if this use is by a non-profit entity. As an example, a for-profit corporation’s use of the Licensed Educational Content for internal professional development or training of employees is permitted, so long as the corporation charges no fees, directly or indirectly, for such use. Conversely, as another example, a non-profit entity’s use of the Licensed Educational Content in connection with an fee-based training or educational program is NOT “non-commercial” and is not permitted.
7.45 Crediting IiPoetTree. If You distribute, publicly perform or display, transmit, publish, or otherwise make available any Licensed Educational Content or any derivative works thereof, You must also provide the following notice prominently along with such Licensed Educational Content or derivative work thereof: “All IiPoetTree content is available for free at www.iPoetTree.org”.

9. Third-Party Sites, Products and Services; Links. The Website may include links or references to other web sites or services solely as a convenience to Users (“Reference Sites”). IiPoetTree does not endorse any such Reference Sites or the information, materials, products, or services contained on or accessible through Reference Sites.

12.3 Harm to Your Computer. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE, ACCESS, DOWNLOAD, OR OTHERWISE OBTAINING OF CONTENT, WEBSITE MATERIALS, SOFTWARE, OR DATA THROUGH THE WEBSITE (INCLUDING THROUGH ANY API’S) IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY (INCLUDING YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM) OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS THEREFROM. 
12.4 Limitations by Applicable Law. SOME STATES OR OTHER JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM STATE TO STATE AND JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. 
13. Limitation of Liability and Damages. 
13.1 Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NEGLIGENCE, WILL IPOETTREE OR ITS AFFILIATES, CONTRACTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR THIRD-PARTY PARTNERS, LICENSORS, OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, RELIANCE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES ARISING FROM ANY UNSUCCESSFUL COURT ACTION OR LEGAL DISPUTE, LOST BUSINESS, LOST REVENUES OR PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY OR NON-PECUNIARY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE TERMS OR YOUR USE OF (OR INABILITY TO USE) THE WEBSITE OR ANY REFERENCE SITES, OR ANY OTHER INTERACTIONS WITH IPOETTREE, EVEN IF IPOETTREE OR A IPOETTREE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

IPOETTREE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE WEBSITE TO YOU ON AN ECONOMICALLY REASONABLE BASIS WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS.
14. Miscellaneous. 
14.1 Notice. IiPoetTree may provide You with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail, postings on the Website, or other reasonable means. Notice will be deemed given twenty-four hours after email is sent, unless IiPoetTree is notified that the email address is invalid. Alternatively, we may give You legal notice by mail to a postal address, if provided by You through the Website. In such case, notice will be deemed given three days after the date of mailing. Notice posted on the Website is deemed given 30 days following the initial posting.
14.2 Waiver. The failure of IiPoetTree to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of the Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by IiPoetTree.
14.3 Dispute Resolution and Arbitration. 
(a) Governing Law. The Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. 
(b) Arbitration. For any claim related to the Terms or the Website, excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief, where the total amount sought is less than ten thousand U.S. Dollars ($10,000.00 USD), either IiPoetTree or You may elect at any point in or during a dispute or proceeding to resolve the claim through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. A party electing arbitration shall initiate it through an established alternative dispute resolution ("ADR") provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted, at the option of the party seeking relief, by telephone, online, or based solely on written submissions; (b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
(c) Jurisdiction. You agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to the Terms or IiPoetTree will be filed only in the state or federal courts in and for Santa ClaraLos Angeles County, California, and each of You and IiPoetTree hereby consent and submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action, except as provided in Section 14.3(b) regarding arbitration. Notwithstanding this, IiPoetTree shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive or other equitable relief to protect or enforce its intellectual property rights in any court of competent jurisdiction.
(d) Improperly Filed Claims. All claims you bring against IiPoetTree must be resolved in accordance with this Section 14.3. All claims filed or brought contrary to this Section 14.3 shall be considered improperly filed. Should either party file a claim contrary to this Section 14.3, the other party may recover attorneys' fees and costs up to one thousand U.S. Dollars ($1,000.00 USD), provided that such party seeking such fees has notified the other in writing of the improperly filed claim, and the other has failed to promptly withdraw the claim.
