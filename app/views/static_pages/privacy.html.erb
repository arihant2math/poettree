    iPoetTree Privacy Principles

<p dir="ltr">
    Our Privacy Notice is fueled by our commitment to the following Privacy
    Principles:
</p>
<ol>
    <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">
            We’re deeply committed to creating a safe and secure online

    <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">
            We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We
            established ourselves as a not-for-profit organization so that our

    <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">
            We strive to provide you with access to and control over the

    <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">
            We take extra precautions for our younger learners under the age of

    About iPoetTree and our Privacy Notice
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    iPoetTree, Inc. (“iPoetTree”, “us”, or “we”) feels strongly about
    protecting your privacy. We understand how important privacy is to you, and
    we are committed to creating a safe and secure environment for learners of
    all ages. This Privacy Notice applies to iPoetTree.org, our mobile
    application, our application programming interface (“API”), and online
    services (collectively, our “Properties”), which are all owned and operated
    by iPoetTree. This Privacy Notice describes how iPoetTree collects and uses
    the information you provide on our Properties, and describes the choices
    available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you
    can access and update this information.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    As a not-for-profit, 501(c)(3) organization, we use the data we collect to
    provide you with a better experience and fulfill our mission of providing a
    free poetry curriculum for anyone, anywhere. We established ourselves as a
    not-for-profit organization so that a for-profit motive will not interfere
    with our mission of providing a trusted educational resource.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Our Privacy Notice describes what information we gather from our members
    and others who visit and use our Properties, how we use that information,
    and what we do to protect it. By visiting or using our Properties, you
    consent to the information handling practices described in this Privacy
    Notice.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Your use of our Properties and any information you provide on our
    Properties are subject to the terms of this Privacy Notice, which is
    incorporated into and subject to our Terms of Service. Any capitalized
    terms used but not defined within this Privacy Notice have the meaning
    given to them in our Terms of Service.
</p>
<hr/>
<p dir="ltr">
    How we collect and use data
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    We take the information you provide to us very seriously, and we strive to
    put you in control of decisions around your information.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    iPoetTree collects the following information about you and your use of our
    Properties:
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Personal Information.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    When you register for, browse and use our Properties, you may provide to
    iPoetTree what is generally called “personally identifiable information” or
    “personal data” (such as your full name, email address, or a photograph of
    yourself) that can be used to identify you. At iPoetTree, we call this data
    “Personal Information”.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Information from Integrated Services like Facebook or Google.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    If you decide to register through or otherwise grant access to a
    third-party social networking or integrated service (what we call an
    “Integrated Service”), such as Facebook Connect or Google, iPoetTree may
    also collect Personal Information that is already associated with your
    Integrated Service account. You may also have the option of sharing
    additional information with iPoetTree through an Integrated Service. If you
    choose to provide such information, during registration or otherwise, you
    are giving iPoetTree the permission to use, share, and store it in a manner
    consistent with this Privacy Notice.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Information about your use of our Properties and other User-provided
    Information.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    We may collect usage information about your use of certain features on our
    Properties, such as the number of problems you have attempted, the number
    of videos you have viewed, and the amount of time spent to complete a
    problem. This enables us to better tailor educational experiences that are
    most appropriate for you.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Information obtained from other Users.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    We make available certain features on our Properties that allow other Users
    to provide us information about you. This information may include Personal
    Information. Generally, this occurs when parents or teachers provide
    information relating to a Child User. For example, a parent may register an
    account for their child and provide us with certain information, such as
    the Child’s User name and birthday.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Location Information.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    We may collect and use information about your location (such as your
    country) to provide you with tailored educational experiences for your
    region, but we don’t collect the precise geolocation of you or your device.
    You may be able to change the settings on your computer or mobile device to
    prevent it from providing us with any location information.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Information from Other Sources.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    In certain situations, we may obtain information, including Personal
    Information, from third parties or sources other than our Properties. For
    example, if you donate to iPoetTree via PayPal, we may obtain your name and
    mailing address to send a thank you note, or if you apply for a job with
    iPoetTree via an online recruiting site, we will obtain the information you
    provide in your application for that purpose. If we combine or associate
    information from other sources with Personal Information that we collect
    through our Properties, we will treat the combined information as Personal
    Information in accordance with this Privacy Notice.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    iPoetTree uses this information in the following ways:
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    To enhance our Properties and the services we provide.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    iPoetTree uses the information you provide or that we collect to enhance
    our relationship with you and to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide
    all of the features and services found on our Properties. iPoetTree, for
    instance, remembers your recent activity so we can recommend the most
    appropriate content for you on your next visit. If you have given iPoetTree
    consent, we may use your Personal Information to provide you with
    information about iPoetTree’s features, services and other offerings that
    may be of interest to you. Under certain circumstances and if we obtain
    your consent (for example, if you submit a testimonial and agree to make it
    public), we may post your Personal Information on our Properties.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    To understand how you and other Users use our Properties.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    iPoetTree uses all of the information that you provide or that we collect
    from Users to understand and analyze the usage trends, learning behaviors,
    and preferences of our Users, to improve the way the Properties work and
    look, and to create new features and functionality. For more information,
    please see the “Technologies” section, below.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    To enable your participation in iPoetTree partnership arrangements.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    iPoetTree will not share Personal Information with other third-party
    organizations for their marketing or promotional use without your consent
    or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have
    the ability to opt-in. You can grant us permission to share your Personal
    Information with authorized partners, not-for-profit organizations, and
    other entities that are not affiliated with iPoetTree. In these cases, we
    will only provide to these third parties the information you have
    authorized or asked us to share to these third parties.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    If you participate in special programs, iPoetTree may collect personal
    information from you to facilitate those programs. This information may be
    shared with our program partners for research or evaluation purposes or as
    otherwise permitted under this Privacy Notice.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    iPoetTree may send information or offers to you on behalf of these third
    parties. For example, if we partner with a not-for-profit organization
    running a contest in your region and send you an email notifying you of the
    partnership, we will only share your information with the third party if
    you opt-in to participate in the contest, and if so, the information we
    would share would be limited to that needed to facilitate your
    participation in the contest and enable you to redeem your prize.
</p>
<hr/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Data Retention.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Unless we receive a deletion request, we will retain your information for
    as long as your account is active or as is reasonably useful for
    operational purposes.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Technical Information.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    To provide a personalized learning and high-quality experience for our
    Users, we may use various technologies that automatically record certain
    technical information from your browser or device, including standard log
    files, web beacons, or pixel tags. This technical information may include
    your Internet Protocol (IP) address, device or browser type, Internet
    service provider (ISP), referring or exit pages, clickstream data,
    operating system, and the dates and times that you visit the Website. We do
    this to better understand how our Users are using our Website so we can
    improve site functionality and the services we offer you.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Like most websites, whether or not you are a registered member, we may send
    one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric
    characters – to your computer. Cookies remember information about your
    activities on a website and enable us to provide you with a more
    personalized learning experience. iPoetTree may use both session cookies
    and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears automatically after you
    close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your
    browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the
    Website. You can, however, remove a persistent cookie at any time. Please
    review your web browser “Help” file to learn the proper way to modify your
    cookie settings. However, without cookies you will not have access to
    certain services and features on the Website.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    iPoetTree may use a variety of third-party service providers, such as
    YouTube to host our videos or Google Analytics to understand our Website
    usage. We may allow third-party service providers to place and read their
    own cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to collect information
    through the Website. This information is collected directly and
    automatically by these third parties, and iPoetTree does not participate in
    these data transmissions. iPoetTree will, wherever feasible, contractually
    obligate our third-party service providers to abide by the terms of this
    Privacy Notice.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    iPoetTree may also uses Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 to store
    content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to
    provide certain features on our site may use LSOs such as HTML5 to collect
    and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management
    tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. Please consult your browser’s “Help”
    function to learn more.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    How we share or transfer data
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    iPoetTree takes great care to protect the information you provide us. We do
    not rent or sell Personal Information that we collect from Users with third
    parties. We also take great measures to restrict any collection or
    disclosure of Personal Information from children less than 13 years of age.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    iPoetTree will disclose User information only as described below:
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    If you want information shared with other Users, we’ll share it for you.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    We provide certain features that may allow you to share information with
    other Users. For example, you may choose to share your poems or other
    literary works with other Users or populate your profile with your name,
    short biography, and location. Or you may ask questions that are visible to
    other Users of iPoetTree. Whenever you share information with other Users
    of our Properties, any Personal Information that you choose to include in,
    or is associated with, such User Postings will be accessible by such Users.
    As with most online services, once you make your Personal Information
    available to others in any of these ways, it may be collected and used by
    the recipients without restriction.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    We may share data with social networks at your request.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Some of our Users choose to connect their iPoetTree account with social
    networks. This functionality is entirely optional. If you have explicitly
    agreed that we may do so, iPoetTree may disclose your Personal Information
    through a social network or similar service (like Facebook or Google). To
    control the information that you share, you have the option of modifying
    your iPoetTree or social network settings or disconnecting your social
    network account from your iPoetTree account.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    We may share data with third-party applications that you authorize.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Third-party application developers and service providers (commonly known as
    “App Developers“) may build complementary services for our platform, such
    as a mobile application for visually-impaired learners to access our
    resources. You may request we share your information with App Developers by
    connecting to the application or service and approving access to your
    iPoetTree account.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    We will share data when required by law.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    iPoetTree may also disclose User information if required to do so by law,
    or if we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply
    with local, state, federal, international, or other applicable laws (such
    as U.S. Copyright law) or respond to a court order, judicial or other
    government subpoena, or warrant, or administrative request. In some cases,
    we may make such disclosures without first providing notice to Users.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    We may share data when necessary or appropriate to protect iPoetTree or
    others.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    iPoetTree may disclose information that we believe, in good faith, is
    appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability; to protect
    iPoetTree from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and
    defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; to assist
    government enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of
    our Properties; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of
    iPoetTree, our Users, or others.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Limitations on Access to your Personal Information by Employees and
    Authorized Parties.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    iPoetTree’s employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate
    business reason to access Personal Information you provide to iPoetTree. We
    may share your Personal Information with third-party service providers,
    including outside contractors or agents who help us manage our information
    activities, but they may only use your Personal Information to provide us
    with a specific service and not for any other purpose. Where feasible,
    iPoetTree will require our third-party service providers to comply with
    this Privacy Notice.
</p>
<hr/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Your choice and options in our data collection, use, and transfer
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    You can choose to not provide us with Personal Information.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    You may always decline to share your Personal Information with iPoetTree.
    Registration is not required to access most of our course content and
    curriculum. If you decline to register, however, iPoetTree will not be able
    to provide to you certain features and functionalities found on our
    Properties. You may later enable or access those features by providing
    iPoetTree with the necessary Personal Information.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    You can edit or delete Personal Information in our records.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    We want you to have access to your information, so that you can help keep
    it as accurate as possible. If you register and provide iPoetTree with
    Personal Information, you may update, correct, or delete your account and
    information at any time by reviewing your profile information and
    preferences on your account settings page. Parents can modify or delete
    Child User accounts. If you experience any difficulties in this process,
    please contact us as described below.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    You can disconnect us from Integrated Services.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    You may revoke iPoetTree’s access to your account on any Integrated
    Service, such as Google or Facebook, at any time by updating the
    appropriate settings in the account preferences of the respective
    Integrated Service. You should check your privacy settings on each
    Integrated Service to understand and change the information sent to us
    through each Integrated Service. Please review each Integrated Service’s
    terms of use and privacy policies carefully before using their services and
    connecting to our Properties.
</p>
<hr/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Child Users
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    iPoetTree is committed to children’s privacy.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important to
    iPoetTree. For that reason, we created certain features designed to help
    protect Personal Information relating to children who are less than 13
    years of age (“Child Users”). iPoetTree does not knowingly permit Child
    Users to register directly for our Properties. If iPoetTree learns that
    Personal Information of a Child User has been collected on our Properties
    without parental consent, then iPoetTree will take appropriate steps to
    delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian (“Parent”) and
    discover that your child under the age of 13 has a registered account with
    our Properties without your consent, please alert iPoetTree at
    <a href="mailto:information.iPoetTree@gmail.com">
        information.iPoetTree@gmail.com
    </a>
    and request that we delete that child’s personal information from our
    systems.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    How children may register for and use our Properties.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Child Users cannot register for an iPoetTree account themselves. If a Child
    User attempts to register for our Properties, iPoetTree will request the
    email address of that Child User’s Parent in order to seek consent from
    that Parent. No information about Child Users is retained during their
    registration attempt, except the Parent email address for purposes of
    seeking consent.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    If you are a Parent, you may provide consent for your child’s registration
    by first registering yourself on our Properties. Once registered, you can
    create a restricted account for your Child User, monitor the data on your
    Child User’s account, or revoke a child’s permission to use the Properties
    by deleting the account.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Alternatively, your child can be registered to use the Properties through
    his or her school, or through an integration with the Properties that is
    supported by the child’s school, or by teachers, tutors and other similar
    adults who assist in the educational process (“Coaches”) who have taken
    steps to obtain parental consent. Parents always have the option to delete
    their Child User’s account.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Restrictions on Child Users.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    iPoetTree attempts to restrict a Child User’s access to certain features
    that could result in disclosure of Personal Information by the Child User.
    A restricted account limits sharing and displaying private information
    about the Child User in various ways, which may include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">
            Restricted accounts may not include the Child User’s real name or
            biography section; only the Child User’s username is displayed
        </p>
    </li>
    <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">
            The Parent can edit Personal Information found in the restricted
            account
        </p>
    </li>
    <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">
            The Parent can restrict Child Users from adding Coaches
        </p>
    </li>
    <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">
            The profile is not shared publicly, and only the Parent and other
            permitted Coaches can see the user’s profile
        </p>
    </li>
    <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">
            The Child User cannot post to public discussion forums
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">
    Some other features of our Properties may, however, permit a Child User to
    enter free-form text through which the Child User could enter Personal
    Information that would be visible to other Users. This may occur, for
    instance, if a Child User enters Personal Information in answering an
    exercise problem or creating other projects on our Properties. If you are
    the Parent of a Child User, please advise your Child User of the risks of
    posting Personal information on our Properties or any other online
    services, as information posted may be used by others without restriction.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    As a Parent, you can choose to share information about your child as you
    deem appropriate. iPoetTree won’t share Personal Information about your
    child or his/her progress with anyone other than you, your child and any
    permitted Coaches, unless we receive your permission (or as otherwise noted
    in this Privacy Notice).
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    As a Parent, you have the ability to control information about your Child
    User. To review, update, or delete information collected from your Child
    User, you can do so in the “Your Children” section within your account. To
    refuse future collection or use of your child’s Personal Information, you
    can delete your Child User’s account or contact us at
    information.iPoetTree@gmail.com.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    California Children’s Privacy Rights
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    If you are under the age of 18, or the parent of a User under the age of
    18, residing in California, you are entitled to request removal of content
    or information you have posted on our Properties. If you would like to
    request removal of your or your child’s content or information, please
    email us at information.iPoetTree@gmail.com for assistance, or you can
    delete specific information (or delete your or your child’s account)
    directly. Please note that removal of your content or information does not
    ensure complete or comprehensive removal, as there may be deidentified or
    recoverable elements of your content or information on our servers in some
    form. Additionally, we will not remove content or information that we may
    be required to retain under applicable federal and state laws.

<p dir="ltr">
    Our approach to Data Security
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Data security is important to you, and to us.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify
    your identity before granting you account access or making corrections to
    your information. For example, we may ask you to provide certain Personal
    Information to confirm your identity, and we may require that you create
    and use a password to access certain parts of our Properties. You should
    create and maintain a strong password to help ensure the security of your
    account.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    We try to ensure that our Properties and information sent to us are safe,
    but no security measures are perfect.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    iPoetTree uses certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards
    designed to preserve the integrity and security of your Personal
    Information and other information we maintain in connection with our
    Properties. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any or
    all of the information you transmit to iPoetTree, and you do so at your own
    risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, iPoetTree makes
    commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems.
    However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may
    not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our
    physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    We will notify you electronically or via the Properties if iPoetTree
    experiences a data security incident that could affect you.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    If we learn of a data security incident that compromises or appears to
    compromise your Personal Information, then we will attempt to notify you
    electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may
    also post a notice on our Properties if a data security incident occurs.
